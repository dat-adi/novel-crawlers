### A little about novel-crawlers
The purpose for making this repository was for the convenience of being able to read the books on my phone offline, as I'm used to travelling a lot and mobile data is quite the issue.
Having found no epubs online for download, I've sought out to make this repository with a few python scripts to let me get my content.

I hold no power over the content, and all credit to the books and the amazing content inside them, should be given to the authors.\
So, please support them, as this is simply a project made for convenience and nothing else.
